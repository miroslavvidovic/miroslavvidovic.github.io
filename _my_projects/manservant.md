Fed up with browsing manual pages in a console using `less` or Googling for
the man page only to realize that your local install differs from the man page
you found? Me too, so I forked the original [Manservant](https://github.com/jimeh/manservant), fixed some issues and improved it to serve up
local man pages over HTTP with some pretty UI sprinkled over it.

Used technologies: Ruby, Sinatra, Bash, Perl, Bootstrap
