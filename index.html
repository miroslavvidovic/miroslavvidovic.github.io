	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Miroslav Vidović</span> IT Engineer, Software Developer and Linux Enthusiast.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I got introduced to programming in high school with Turbo Pascal and absolutely hated it. Later I discoverd Java and with it a passion and love for coding. At some point eventually, like the whole software industry I shiftted my focus to the web and started working with the LAMP platform.</p>
	<p>Currently I'am exploring the MEAN stack and Meteor framework.</p>
	<p>I started using Linux out of curiosity and it soon became my favourite OS. I tried many distributions but stayed loyal to Ubuntu.<p>
	<p>Other IT fields I am familiar with and have interest in are System Administration and Digital Forensics.</p>

	<p>I'm also available for hire as a <span itemprop="title">freelance software / web developer or designer</span>. <a href="contact">Contact me</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
